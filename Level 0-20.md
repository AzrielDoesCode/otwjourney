[[BANDIT]]


**LEVEL 0**  
Login to bandit labs using ssh as Bandit0 user by the code 
	`ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220` 
Then use Nano Terminal Text reader to get the key by the command  
	`nano readme`

**LEVEL 1** 
Access the server using SSH as Bandit1 similarly, this time using the code retrieved from the last level
Here the name of the file is "-" NOW here we will need to do smthn different to access as the file using NANO since the name consists of a symbol at the first character; modification reqd is { ./  }
such that
	`nano ./-`       (easier unified way to remember :p)
giving us

**LEVEL 5**
emphasize on the DU, FILE and FIND commands now

	`find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable`
where;
- -type f → only files.

- -size 1033c → exactly 1033 bytes (c = bytes).

- ! -executable → exclude executables.

and you get the code!

**LEVEL 6**
Here also we will need to use FIND command this time exactly following the Info given directly while writiing the  command 

`find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c`
- owned by user bandit7
- owned by group bandit6
- 33 bytes in size

find .
- The . refers to the current working directory.
- Example: If you’re in /home/dhruv/projects, then:
	`find . `
- will list everything under /home/dhruv/projects recursively.


find /
- The / refers to the root directory of the entire filesystem.
- Example:
	`find /`
- will traverse every directory on the system: /bin, /etc, /home, /var, /usr, etc.
